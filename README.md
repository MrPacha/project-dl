# project-dl
This github contains the work performed by our group. We built a variational auto-encoder with the goal of generating images of galaxies, using the GalaxyZoo2 image dataset. We first built a VAE of which the encoder and the decoder were both MLP, and then where they were both CNN models. 

NB: the "utils" folders are important, as they contain the functions necessary for importing the samples of the GalaxyZoo2 in the working space.
